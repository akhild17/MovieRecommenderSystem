**Movie Recommender System**

This project focuses on creating a movie recommendation framework using Python and Big Data technologies. By leveraging data transformation and visualization techniques, we aim to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences.

Dataset:
We will use the Kaggle Movies Dataset, which contains information about approximately 5000 movies from TMDb. This dataset includes details such as movie title, genre, director, cast, budget, revenue, and ratings.

Approach:
Data Exploration: Utilize big data tools to ingest, transform, and analyze the IMDb dataset.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features such as movie genre, director, and cast to enhance recommendation accuracy.
Model Development: Develop recommendation models using machine learning techniques to predict movie preferences.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using various metrics to ensure accurate recommendations.
Visualization: Visualize insights and recommendations to enhance user understanding and engagement.
